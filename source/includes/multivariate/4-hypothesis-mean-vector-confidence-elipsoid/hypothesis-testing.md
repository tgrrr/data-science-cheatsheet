# Hypothesis testing

m = number of means
Large sample theory can be constructed without the normality assumption



TODO: add we don't need normality assumption for large sample theory

## 1. Hotelling T^2 test
19.35 Starts 
Assumptions:
- Multivariate normal distribution (formula) X squigle N vP (mu, sigma)
- Representative Sample
- independence of observations

3. 
4. 
! Interpret the results:
With T^2 = 7/9
   and F <sub>(2,1)</sub> (0.1) = 49.5
   we fail to reject the null hypothesis

There is insufficient evidence to show that the mean vector is different to μ' = [9 5]   <- Always relate back to the problem
   
## 2. Confidence Region for μ

- Eigenvalues tell us length
- Eigenvectors tell us direction

c^2 is adjusted F

## 3. Simultaneous Confidence Interval

## 4. Bonferroni Intervals



## 5. Large Sample Theory

n is large relative to p

X<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>

Large sample theory can be constructed without the normality assumption

## 6. Large Sample - Hypothesis testing for mu

- Compare to chi squared
- Roughly equal to chi squared

## 7. Large Sample - Confidence Region for mu

## 8. Large Sample - Simultaneous Confidence Intervals
