## Multivariate Notation

for notation in Multivariate

something  = [ first v(observation) sub(variable) ]
something  = [ first v(row) sub(column) ]



Bold means Multivariate

#### Principles:
Can't divide matrix division
So we multiply by inverse

### Identity matrix is 

Looks like this:
[ 1 0 0, 
  0 1 0,
  0 0 1]
Is the Matrix version of 1.
Therefore: multiply by identity matrix is same as multiply by 1.

#### Inverse
something^-1

so A x A^-1 = 1
And A^-1 x A = 1

for 

matrix = 

[ a b, 
  c d ]

matrix^-1 = 

1 / (ad - bc)

#### determinant
(ad - bc) is determinant
`| determinant |` two lines
viewed as scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix

#### Transpose
something^T or something'
a Sigma a'
a x a' = a^2

#### Terminology

`dot product` refers to multiplication

`cross product` is something else
