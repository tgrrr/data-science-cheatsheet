/* #### TODO: Discuss whether this meets your expectations. (2 marks) */

/* Doesn't meet my expectations because current world records for track records are:

Women's records are from USA, France, Soviet, Romania, Kenya, Ethiopia
Men all from Africa (Jamaica, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia)

Possibly because date of the records isn't supplied.
Further investigation could compare current world records accross all countries

Ranked by Principle Component 1 (accross all track records)
