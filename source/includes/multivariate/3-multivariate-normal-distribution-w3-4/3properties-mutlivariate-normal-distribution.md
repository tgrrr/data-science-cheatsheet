Properties of multivariate normal vector

- each variable has univariate normal distribution
- subset is multivariate normal distribution
- linear combination has univariate normal distribution
- Any conditional distribution of components are multivariate normal 

## Bivariate Normal Distribution.
Consider a bivariate normal random vector X. That is,
X ∼ N2(μ,Σ)

Σ = [
σ11 σ12,
σ11 σ12
]
