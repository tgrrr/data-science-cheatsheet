# 3. Types of variables

TODO: summarise
Nominal variable: They have a scale in which the numbers or letters assigned to objects serve as labels for identification or classification. Examples of this variable include binary variables (e.g., yes/no, male/female) and multinomial variables (e.g. religious affiliation, eye colour, ethnicity, suburb).

Ordinal variable: They have a scale that arranges objects or alternatives according to their ranking. Examples include the exam grades (i.e., HD, DI, Credit, Pass, Fail etc.) and the disease severity (i.e., severe, moderate, mild).

The second type of variable is called the quantitative variable. These variables are the numerical data that we can either measure or count. The quantitative variables can be either discrete or continuous.

Continuous quantitative variable: They arise from a measurement process. Continuous variables are measured on a continuum or scale. They can have almost any numeric value and can be meaningfully subdivided into finer and finer increments, depending upon the precision of the measurement system. For example: time, temperature, wind speed may be considered as continuous quantitative variables.

Discrete quantitative variable: They arise from a counting process. Examples include the number of text messages you sent this past week and the number of faults in a manufacturing process.
