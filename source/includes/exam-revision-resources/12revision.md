#### Instructions

● The following quiz will give you a sense of the questions that will be asked in the
final exam.
● As you will discover, there are no questions on R coding!
● You will compete in groups for an awesome prize!
● Each slide will present a multiple choice or short answer question
● You will have a limited amount of time to discuss the answer with your group.
● Your group must write the answer on the whiteboard before time is up.
● Each group will be scored and a running tally updated.
● The group with the highest score at the end of the quiz will be the winner.

#### Question 23
Remember back to Week 4. A student was about to
attempt a 100 question multiple choice exam without
any preparation. Each multiple choice question has
three distractors and one correct answer. Each question
is independent so, the probability of guessing correctly is
always 25%. Assuming the student guesses on every
question, the exam score can be modelled using a
binomial distribution shown to the right. Using this
scenario and the plot provided, answer the following
questions:
a. What is the expected score for the student?
b. What is the approximate probability the student
will pass?
c. What is the approximate probability the student
will score under 25%?
d. Is it more likely the student will score less than 17
or more than 35?

Bonus points: Estimate that correlation!
● If we have time and the scores are close….
● You will be shown a series of scatter plots of bivariate data.
● Estimate the Pearson correlation coefficient.
● If you get within ± 0.05 of the true value, you get a point.
