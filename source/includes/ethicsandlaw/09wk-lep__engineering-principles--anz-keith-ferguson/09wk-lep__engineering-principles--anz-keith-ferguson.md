# Visualisation and front end design
#### 09wk-lep

## tl;dr:


## Good design:
- Be interesting
  - person cares
- Communicate what you want it to communicate
- Multiple graphs: make it consistent
  - eg. Green should = people in all graphs
- Logical sequence

- Someone should know:
  - What to look at
  - What they should be doing ???
  - What they can get out of it

- if they have to work too hard, they wont care

Conventions are groundwork
  - What should go in graphs
  - Where they should go
  - What you should do with them
  -> wont have to teach them a new thing
  
## Bad design:

- Care about colour
  - [Colorbrewer]
  - Think about colour-blind
  - Don't copy well, or don't project well
- Clarity
  - If need phd to understand, it's not useful
  - Don't gatekeep data

## UI: first use
  - Bad time first times
    - Eg social media site
      - Google: simple introduction
      - Instagram
  - Avoid being stuck in the corner
  - Either explicit tutorial
    => 
  - Or everything is implicit 
    => hope user gets it. 
    Eg. Google -> simple box


## UI: User flow:
- User comes back to the website
  - what they're going to do after that
- Understanding how people look through apps

### How they use the page
1. centre - what matters
2. top of page (ie search)
3.  left and right (get more personalised navbars)
  - if don't find right thing
4. Scroll down - less important
  - don't expect user to see what's at the bottom?
  - infinite scrolling
    - hopefully they find something they like

Why is this intuitive?

## UI: Conventions

- If the page gives no response, it must be broken
- continue button on right
- eg. 
  - hamburger shouldn't be used as submit form
  - x and y axis
