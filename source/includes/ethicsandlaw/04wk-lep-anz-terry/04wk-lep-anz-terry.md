## Lean and Agile Building
- Terry Szymanski - ANZ
- week 4 - Legal and Ethics of Data Science


tl;dr:
- ruthlessly lean approach
- Eliminate the risk of non-delivery - Tez
- Everything is easier the second time around

Eg.
Netflix competition
model
too complicated to train
too slow at runtime to make predictions
models can be impractical in industry situations

## Lean 

1. Think lean => think leaner
2. go end-to-end
- build all of the components
  => eliminates the risk of non-delivery
3. Build-measure-learn
- continuous delivery
4. End 
- Know when to stop
- then pivot/persevere

vs Waterfall
- Contrasts to waterfall

- How to succeed with conditions of extreme uncertainty
- Maximise learning
- Minimise wasted time and effort

- Who are my customers?
- Are my customers willing to pay for this product?
- Test hypothesis with MVP

Not bad or inferior product
just minimal

## Agile:
- Project management
- Planning
- Iterative cycles


Eg.
Have model
- Want to predict age of customers
- Don't know age of customers

ideas:
- unsupervised
- classification
- k nearest neighbours
- Leaner?
  - Decision tree
  - mean?
- not regression
- people who have used app in past


- "Eliminate the risk of non-delivery" - Tez
- Eg. If you have 2 months:
  - Finish the first version in a week
  - If things go horribly wrong, you still have something to show
  - Benefit: Identify any roadblocks as early as possible
  - Everything is easier the second time around

If you're trying to solve a micro-version

- Good: Breaking into data and app -> I think he was talking about our team
- Problems: Iterations and continual delivery

TODO:

- Agile slide
- Microsoft slide


Can it scale?
Will it be written in one language, then in another language


## Intrinsic vs extrinsic evaluation

Intrinsic
- training set vs test set
  - how 

Extrinsic
- Not measuring how well it works in the context
  - are the users of the app happier?
  - Eg. A/B testing with App


Iterative

Build-measure-learn cycle
focus on measure step
best = predefined metrics

building towards a specific goal
- optimise the metrics


### Lean:
- Quick to implement
- Efficient training and inference times
- Interpretable - is it doing a good job/why is it doing a good job?
- Scalability potential
  - Prototype -> production
- Integrated - Can be integrated into broader systems



### Not lean:
- Not the above
- Latest and greatest new library (if you've never used it)
- Lots of parameter tuning or feature engineering
- opaque / black box


### Are these lean techniques?

Lean:


Not lean:

- Logistic regression
- Random forrest
- K-nearest neighbour
- Deep learning
- Rule-based systems


## An actual example:

feature D will be time-consuming
So did the rest of the report with a place-holder for D

## When to stop

- Resist the urgel to build the perfect model- 
- Apply the 80:20 rule on when to stop

Avoid the things that are high-effort and low-value


## Problems:

- Project might die an early death
- MVP=production build - First thing you build is the lat thing you build
- Problem seeing sausages - client might not be used to seeing WIP

## Therefore:

- Communicate clearly with clients
- Lean =/ inferrior
- Stick with the process

tl;dr:

go end-to-end
  build the leanest model possible
iterate, iterate, Iterate
  - use the value graph to prioritise work for easy wins
  - put yourself in the shoes of stakeholders at each iteration

Unblock team-members
- minimise dependencies between team-members
- so nobody is blocked by other members
- collaborate continuously - don't wait till the end

- Measure progress
- Iterate in structured way
