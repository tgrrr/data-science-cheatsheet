1. Data pipeline
2. Machine Learning
3. Front-end UI
(TODO: circular diagram)

### Data science lifecycle

1. Problem formulation
  - define pain points
  - business scenarios
    - When?
    - What?
  - lit review
  - model problem formulation
2. Data sourcing
  - Can break: data availability
  - get sources
  - cleaning
  - feature engineering


3. Machine Learning
  - Can break: model performance: feature effectiveness
  - model
  - model validation
  - model release
4. Deployment and maintenance
  - Can break: market performance / user experience
  - business integration
  - a/b testing
  - performance tracking

(see round diagram with 4 circles)

-----------------------

in 2: data sourcing:
(another arbitrary definition):

- Data Engineering
  - cleanse
  - conform
  - shape
  - transform
  - ingest
- Data preparation
  - refine
  - orchestrate
  - virtualise
  - blend
  - prepare
  - enrich
- Analytics
  - build
  - score
  - model
  - visualise
  - analyse


#### Manage and automate the pipeline (figure)
- Administration
- Security
- Lifecycle management
- Data provenance
- Dynamic data pipeline
- Monitoring
- automation


-----------------------

## Problems

- most complicated solution
- heavy stakeholder engagement to define best outcomes
- extreme uncertainty
- resources are expensive

Therefore:
- Datascience as startups
- lean methodology

---------------------------

LEAN
- build - experiment
- measure 
  - actionable metrics
  - build a MVP
    - it should be terrible
- learn - pivot / persevere
  - pivot - because disprove hypothesis
  - persevere - because proved hypothesis


idea -> hypothesis -> experiment design -> experimentation -> pivot/persevere

-----------------------

Use the data provided (maybe a summarised version) and your data science and developer skills to build a 

- world-class application 
- with a beautiful, user-friendly interface, 
- powered by some serious machine learning and 
- analytics under the hood 
- to bring your insights to life.

- Is the data presented in a way that tells a **good story**, 
- highlighting **key insights**?
- Are those **insights actionable** – i.e. could a stakeholder make a practical business decision based on the data?
- Does the application effectively make use of **current technology**?
- Is the application **scalable** – could it easily be transitioned from a prototype to a production app on industry-sized data.
