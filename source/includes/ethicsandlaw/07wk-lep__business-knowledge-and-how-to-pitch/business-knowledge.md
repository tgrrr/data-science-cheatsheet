Modelling is only as good as the data
Model building can be point and click
'Correct data prep' will never be this
Rubbish in -> rubbish out
- Don't trust any data (caveat emptor - buyer beware)

Sanity Checking

- Identify systematic data issues
- Predictive modelling assumes the future will be like the past
  - we have to make sure the past is like the past
- TODO: The data contains the questions

- Todo: what's the IBM Watson story?

- If data has more than 1 dimension:
  - always plot it
  - TODO: image of Financial statement dates p11.

# Daily issues

1. Problem statement is not well defined
2. The delivery is beyond your circle of influence
3. Time pressure 
  - without understanding the complexity
4. How you explain the black box, 
  - -> if people cant understand it they will not use it
