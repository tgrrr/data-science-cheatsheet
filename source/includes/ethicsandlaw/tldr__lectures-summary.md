## Course Learning Outcomes

On completion of this course you should be able to:

#### tl;dr:

- Apply relevant standards, ethical and social considerations,
- Social impact
- Privacy threat
- Case studies
- written technical reports and 
- oral presentations
- analyse, theorise and justify conclusions 

#### The longer version:

- Apply relevant standards, ethical and social considerations, 
  - demonstrate an understanding of legal issues to the professional practice of data science
- Analyse and discuss 
  - social impact and 
  - professional issues in the realm of data science, in particular 
  - Privacy: evaluate solutions to privacy threats 
    - within the context of data science practice in industry
- Analyse and evaluate professional practice case studies in teams, and 
  - critically assess the work of peers



## 00

In this course you will discuss issues of privacy, surveillance, security, classification, discrimination and decisional autonomy from a legal, ethical, and policy perspective (whether business or public policy). Areas of relevance include health, marketing, employment, law enforcement, and education are explored in detail.

This course will prepare you for undertaking the Data Science Postgraduate Project (COSC2667) and so includes a work integrated learning experience in which your knowledge and skills will be applied and assessed in a simulated workplace context where feedback from data scientists working in industry is integral to your experience.

## 01

Apply relevant standards, ethical and social considerations, and thus demonstrate an understanding of legal issues to the professional practice of data science
Analyse and discuss social impact and professional issues in the realm of data science, in particular evaluate solutions to privacy threats within the context of data science practice in industry
Analyse and evaluate professional practice case studies in teams, and critically assess the work of peers
Communicate effectively to a variety of audiences through a range of modes and media, specifically, through written technical reports and oral presentations

Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 3: The science of crystal balls - insights versus prediction. There are no pre-readings for this lecture.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives 3, 4 and 5:

3. Analyse and evaluate professional practice case studies in teams, and critically assess the work of peers

4. Communicate effectively to a variety of audiences through a range of modes and media, specifically, through written technical reports and oral presentations

5. Use research principles and choose appropriate methods to analyse, theorise and justify conclusions about new situations in data science professional practice and/or research

Purpose
This week Richard Balson from ANZ will cover the science of crystal balls:

• Prediction
• Insights
• Structural Models

Welcome to Week 4: Datathon workshop. In this class, we will focus on making sure every team has a clear approach to the Datathon. As well as  a couple of presentations from the ANZ team, we will continue the workshop from last week of planning approaches to the Datathon.

Please remember to look at the data and, as a team, think about questions you think it may be interesting to pose. For any teams that are struggling, we want to make sure we help you clarify how to get going by the end of the class.

- [x] summarise

The Bureau of Meteorology has enormous Data Science challenges and incredibly complex modelling and analytic techniques.

Dr. Anthony Rea is the General Manager of Data and Chief Data Officer at the BoM and will discuss challenges around collection, governance, and maintenance of data at BoM, including the challenges of data that is spatially and temporally sensitive, data that is sourced internationally using different representations and standards, and data that is MASSIVE.

The second half of the class will involve further focus on the Datathon with the ANZ Data Science team, including a presentation on Working Well with Others --- i.e., working effectively in a Data Science team.
