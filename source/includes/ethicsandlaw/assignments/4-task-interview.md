## 4 Interview a Data Scientist
Make contact with and interview (for example, over a coffee meeting) a data scientist or, preferably, a manager of data scientists working in industry.

#### The name of the person you interviewed, who they work for and what is their role (include a link to their LinkedIn profile)

__Kevin Chai__
Lead Data Scientist at Curtin University,<br /> 
Curtin Institute for Computation <br />
Perth, Australia <br />
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-chai-1a135a/ <br />
- Did pHD in datamining <br />
- Health and medicine post-doc <br />
- __Stack:__ Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-image

#### the date, time and approximate length of the interview

19 Sept, 1pm. For 1 hour.<br />
(It was the first time he was available)

#### If you could work on any problem, what would it be?

- Tend to build prototypes
- Funding is coming from R&D
- Work with Power ledger and cryptos
- __It's all about silly methods that change the world__

I have a history in health and medicine, and there are lots of places where that can grow. At Curtin, I've worked with a mix of projects including npl, material science, astronomers, and bioinformatics.

I'm not big on the fact that data science has gotten big, but I do enjoy it's *impact* on the world.

#### What are bad recommendations you hear in data science?

Trying to get universities to compete with companies like Deloits

#### A hammer and a nail cost $1.10, and the hammer costs one dollar more than the nail. How much does the nail cost?
5c

#### Give me an example of a time when you solved an analytically difficult problem.

Craters on mars
- Planetary scientists wanted to look back millions of years
  using craters.
- The real problem: is trying to understand the past. 
- Solution: Why not also look at mountains and river beds?

#### What do you ask clients?

- What problem do you have?
- Do you have the data to solve it

#### Should I work in deloits, contractor, open source projects, uni?

- Open source:
  - Helps with your CV
  - Is good early for prestige

- Expected to be a unicorn
  - Soft skills
  - Ability to present because data-science is popular

- Machine learning = researcher
- Data scientist = engineer


#### Tell me something that's true that almost nobody agrees with you on

- Uni isn't necessary
- see nano-degrees
  - Shows people have a passion for tech
- Need to add criticial thinking skills

#### What do data-scientists hate?

- Time-wasting
- Being presented half-baked solutions rather than problems to solve
- Change management:
  - Can be difficult if people think their jobs will be automated
  - Can focus instead on helping with their job, like analysing CT scans

#### What question would a data-scientist ask you in this interview? (That I wouldn't know to ask)

- Are there any other methods other than neural networks to solve the problem.
  - Eg. Back propagation
  - Genetic algorithms (Uber is doing this https://eng.uber.com/deep-neuroevolution/)
