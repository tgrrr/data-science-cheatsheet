## Kick off Meetings

### Create a focus towards the project, specify expectations, identify project members (15 minutes)

#### **Aim** of the project
– Background: 
  eg $2M retail company
– Research: 
  eg. According to Financial Times, sales declining @5% for last three months
  
#### **What** you wish to achieve
– Identify demographics with spending decline
  - age, 
  - gender
– Identify locations with spending decline 
  - store locations, 
  - residential locations
– Identify why spending has declined
  - churn
  - competition increase
  - income impact
  
#### **How** will you achieve
– Analysis (descriptive, demographic behaviour, churn behaviour, competitive analysis, spending analysis)
– Data points (transaction data, demographic data, location data, income data - internal or external)
– Algorithms
  - Random forest 
    - top features that drive churn, 
    - clustering
    – Identify competitors
  - Regression 
    – identify slope spend features
  – Wireframe 
    - Drawing tools, 
    - what will the app look like?
  – Tools (
      - Python for machine learning, 
      - MySQL database to build metrics, tables, etc., 
      - Javascript/HTML/CSS to build the app)

#### Any **road blocks** you have. Eg: 
– I don’t know JavaScript 
– Need to do a course or 
- Power Point the analysis ???


Then:

- Yay agile
- ask 5 why's?

- Defined audience
- Pain points
- Have data?
- Kick off meetings?
- How quick to iterate?
- Define MVP
