! 

- Please notice that the mid-semester test will be an unsupervised, computer-based test! 
- It will be similar to the hands-on task sessions. 

I’ll give you several tasks and ask for the R scripts to solve the tasks and your interpretations of the outputs. 
The test will be available between 7:30 pm and 9:30 pm on 12.04.2019 and you are required to submit the R files including your answers by 9:30 pm. 
- It’s very important for you to attend the task sessions to gain more experience in working under the time pressure. 
- You can take the test anywhere provided that you have access to the Internet and the Canvas shell.  
- There will be a one-hour overview session (starting at 6:30 pm) before the test on 12.04.2019 in the usual lecture theatre.
