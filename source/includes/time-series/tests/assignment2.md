Criteria	Ratings	Pts
This criterion is linked to a learning outcome Reporting
15.0 Pts
Creates Distinction
All inferences are clearly addressed by relevant outputs and given under relevant sections. All bits of the presented output are used for the inferences. There are minor language and formatting issues.
10.0 Pts
Meets Expectation
All inferences are clearly addressed by relevant outputs and given under relevant sections. All bits of the presented output are used for the inferences. There are minor language and formatting issues.
5.0 Pts
Needs Improvement
All inferences are clearly addressed by relevant outputs and given under relevant sections. Some of the output remain without being inferred. There are major language and formatting issues.
0.0 Pts
Not Acceptable
Lacks the basic elements of a precise report. Some of the outputs have not been associated with inferences or there are inferences without supporting evidence.
15.0 pts
This criterion is linked to a learning outcome R Codes
15.0 Pts
Creates Distinction
Scripts to run analyses are working properly and suitable explanations are given. Also, the scripts include functions to implement all analyses in a dynamical way.
10.0 Pts
Meets Expectation
All scripts to run analyses are working properly and suitable explanations are given.
5.0 Pts
Needs Improvement
All scripts to run analyses are working properly. However, it is hard to follow codes to identify what each line does.
0.0 Pts
Not Acceptable
Some of the scripts to run analyses are generating error messages. It is unclear what does each line do in the R codes.
15.0 pts
This criterion is linked to a learning outcome Descriptive analysis
20.0 Pts
Creates Distinction
Uses all suitable plots and descriptive statistics and every plot and descriptive statistic is interpretted in a way to shed a light on further analyses.
15.0 Pts
Meets Expectation
Uses all suitable plots and descriptive statistics and every plot and descriptive statistic has a suitable interpretation.
10.0 Pts
Needs Improvement
Some descriptive plots/statistics are used and/or all presented plots/statistics have interpretations.
0.0 Pts
Not Acceptable
Nearly no descriptive analysis has done and/or the descriptive analysis is in sufficient.
20.0 pts
This criterion is linked to a learning outcome Model accuracy
25.0 Pts
Creates Distinction
Several possible models were identified and the best model in terms of model accuracy is selected using hypothesis tests and other model accuracy measures covered in class.
24.0 Pts
Meets Expectation
Several possible models were identified and the best model in terms of model accuracy is selected using some of the model accuracy measures covered in class.
23.0 Pts
Needs Improvement
Several possible models were identified but the final model is not an accurate one in terms of model accuracy measures covered in class.
0.0 Pts
Not Acceptable
Only one model is focused on and/or it is not an accurate one in terms of model performance measures and quality of model diagnostics.
25.0 pts
This criterion is linked to a learning outcome Diagnostic checking
25.0 Pts
Creates Distinction
All aspects of diagnostic checking were applied and all assumptions of applied approaches were validated.
24.0 Pts
Meets Expectation
Some aspects of diagnostic checking were applied and most of the assumptions of applied approaches were validated.
23.0 Pts
Needs Improvement
Some aspects of diagnostic checking were applied and some of the assumptions of applied approaches were validated.
0.0 Pts
Not Acceptable
There is no effort for diagnostic checking and validation of the assumptions of applied approaches.
