# Final Project - Competitive
Description:
You can work on this assignment independently or as teams (composed of at most four students per team). In short, the challenge is to find the best fitting model to the given cryptocurrency series.

Any form of currency that only exists digitally relying on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions is defined as cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was the very first Cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2009 by an anonymous person, or group of people, who referred to themselves as Satoshi Nakamoto. When someone sends a bitcoin (or a fraction of a bitcoin) to someone else, “miners” record that transaction in a block and add the transaction to a digital ledger. These blocks are collectively known as the blockchain – an openly accessible ledger of every transaction ever made in bitcoin. Blockchains are distributed across many computers so that the record of transactions cannot be altered. Only 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined and about 17 million have been mined so far. Bitcoin is mined or created, by people (miners) getting their computers to solve mathematical problems, in order to update and verify the ledger.

The value of bitcoin is determined by what people are willing to pay for it, and is very volatile, fluctuating wildly from day to day.  In April 2013, the value of 1 bitcoin (BTC) was around $100 USD. At the beginning of 2017 its value was $1,022 USD and by the 15th of December, it was worth $19,497. As of the 3rd of March 2018, 1 BTC was sold for $11,513 USD. But now it came back to the window of $3800 USD - $4000 USD. So, the time series analysis of bitcoin series includes nearly all the aspects we cover during the semester; hence, it is very challenging.

The following dataset is the daily closing price of bitcoin from the 27th of April 2013 to the 24th of February 2019. Source: coinmarketcap.com

The dataset you will focus on has gathered from coinmarketcap.com (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. includes the daily closing price of bitcoin from the 27th of April 2013 to the 24th of February 2019 and is available in the csv file Bitcoin_Historical_Price.csvPreview the document.

Your task is to analyze the data by using the analysis methods covered in MATH1318 Time Series Analysis course in this semester, accurately predict the value of bitcoin for the next 10 days, and prepare a comprehensive analysis report including descriptive analysis, proper visualization, model specification, model fitting and selection, and diagnostic checking.

All the submitted reports will be accepted as the final project report and presented by the team members during final project presentations. Also, the top three reports in terms of accuracy of model fit and forecasts will be awarded extra marks according to the following table:

You will include a mean absolute scaled error (MASE), which you will learn in this semester, for each of model fits and forecasts. You’ll use the real values of daily bitcoin for 10 days of the forecast period (25th of February - 6th of March 2019)Preview the document to compute MASE for forecasts using the R function here.

As in other data science competitions, e.g. Datathon (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., this task will be like a real data science consulting task. So, I will not answer specific questions about data analysis or reporting. Instead, it is expected that you ask yourself what are the elements of a suitable and successful data analysis, and how you might go about presenting your results in a written report format and as an oral presentation. I’m happy to talk on general questions on this task.

Please note that all teams must be registered by sending an email to lecturer 24 April 2018. If you are working individually you should also register yourself by email to the lecturer.

Submission Instructions:
All reports must be submitted via the Turnitin link on the course Canvas shell prior to the due date.
You must submit your assignment over “Turnitin Assignments.”
Your submission should be uploaded as a PDF or Microsoft Word file.
Your report should meet with English language requirements.
Late submissions will be marked in accordance with the late submission policy explained under “Assessment” title of the course information sheet.
Collaboration vs. Collusion and Plagiarism:
You are free to discuss main aspects of the assignment with your classmates. However, keep in mind that this is an individual assignment and you should demonstrate your own effort and understanding. Because assignments will be submitted through Turnitin, all the material you submitted will be checked for plagiarism. If plagiarism is detected, both the copier and the student copied from will be responsible. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure you do not copy or do not allow other classmates to copy your work. You should ensure you understand your responsibilities by reading the RMIT University website on academic integrity (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
