# Final Project - Regular
Description:
You can work on this assignment independently or as teams (composed of at most four students per team).

In this assignment, you will find a time series dataset, preferably a public one, and analyse the data by using the analysis methods covered in MATH1318 Time Series Analysis course in this semester, accurately predict the series for the next 10 units of time, and prepare a comprehensive analysis report including descriptive analysis, proper visualisation, model specification, model fitting and selection, and diagnostic checking.

The quality of data will be assessed in terms of originality of study and difficulty of modeling. Therefore, the length and characteristics of the time series you will choose for the final project is just up to you.

All final project reports submitted will be presented by the team members during final project presentations.

As in other data science competitions, e.g. Datathon (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., this task will be like a real data science consulting task. So, I will not answer specific questions about data analysis or reporting. Instead, it is expected that you ask yourself what are the elements of a suitable and successful data analysis, and how you might go about presenting your results in a written report format and as an oral presentation. I’m happy to talk on general questions on this task.

 

Submission Instructions:
All reports must be submitted via the Turnitin link.
Your submission should be uploaded as a PDF or Microsoft Word file.
Your report should meet with English language requirements.
Late submissions will be marked in accordance with the late submission policy explained under “Assessment” title of the course information sheet.
Collaboration vs. Collusion and Plagiarism:
You are free to discuss main aspects of the assignment with your classmates. However, keep in mind that this is an individual assignment and you should demonstrate your own effort and understanding. Because assignments will be submitted through Turnitin, all the material you submitted will be checked for plagiarism. If plagiarism is detected, both the copier and the student copied from will be responsible. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure you do not copy or do not allow other classmates to copy your work. You should ensure you understand your responsibilities by reading the RMIT University website on academic integrity (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
