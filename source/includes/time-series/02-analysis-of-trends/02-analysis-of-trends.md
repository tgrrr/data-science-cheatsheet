Module 2: Introduction - Time Series

Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 2: We will study trend models for the analysis of time series data. Trend models that we will cover include linear, quadratic and harmonic trend models and those account for seasonality. We will observe that while the trend models are very good on capturing the trend in time series data, their performance is poor on capturing serial correlation in time series data. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of trend models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Present time series in an informative way, both graphically and with summary statistics
2. Develop stationary and non-stationary, and seasonal and non-seasonal time series models
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to complete the analyses required for Assignment 1 and Mid-Semester test.
