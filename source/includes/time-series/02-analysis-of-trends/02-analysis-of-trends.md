# Analysis of trends - Week 2

#### tldr (at the end of slides)

- [ ] In this module, we focused on describing, modelling, and estimating
deterministic trends in time series.
- [ ] The simplest deterministic “trend” is a constant-mean function.
Regression methods were then pursued to estimate trends that are linear or
quadratic in time.
- [ ] Methods for modelling cyclical or seasonal trends came next, and the
reliability and efficiency of all of these regression methods were
investigated.
- [ ] We also introduced the important sample autocorrelation function, which is
a very useful and important tool in the analysis of time series.
- [ ] Finally, we studied residual analysis to investigate the quality of the fitted model

#### Goals

- [ ] set reading
- [ ] self-check?
- [ ] analyses for assignment 1

Module 2: Introduction - Time Series

Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 2: We will study trend models for the analysis of time series data. Trend models that we will cover include linear, quadratic and harmonic trend models and those account for seasonality. We will observe that while the trend models are very good on capturing the trend in time series data, their performance is poor on capturing serial correlation in time series data. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of trend models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Present time series in an informative way, both graphically and with summary statistics
2. Develop stationary and non-stationary, and seasonal and non-seasonal time series models

#### Purpose

By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to complete the analyses required for Assignment 1 and Mid-Semester test.
