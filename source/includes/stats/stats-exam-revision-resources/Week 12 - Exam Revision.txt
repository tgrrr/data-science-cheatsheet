Question 23
Remember back to Week 4. A student was about to attempt a 100 question multiple choice exam without any preparation. Each multiple choice question has three distractors and one correct answer. Each question is independent so, the probability of guessing correctly is always 25%. Assuming the student guesses on every question, the exam score can be modelled using a binomial distribution shown to the right. Using this scenario and the plot provided, answer the following questions:
What is the expected score for the student?
What is the approximate probability the student will pass?
What is the approximate probability the student will score under 25%?
Is it more likely the student will score less than 17 or more than 35?
(4 points)
25%
0%

10 cylinders
4 cylinders
Small sample size, which means the quartiles are all the same value. 
Because the min, and Q1 and max and Q3 must be the same value. 

Question 25

The results of the paired samples t-test comparing the mean difference between father and sons’ heights was not statistically significant, p = .63, mean difference = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.31, 0.19). 

Question 26

       64.11016        69.22882 
No, the assumption of homogeneity of variance was not assumed because the investigators have used the Welch Two-sample t-test. 
H0: Population mean males height - Population mean female height = 0, HA: Population mean males height - Population mean female height does not equal 0.
As the 95% CI of the difference between means (-5.45, -4.79) does not capture H0, H0 was rejected.
There was a statistically significant difference between males and female mean heights. Males were estimated to be taller on average.

Question 27
You’re on holidays and find yourself missing statistics and hypothesis testing. You decide to collect some data by tossing a coin 1000 times to determine if it was fair. You toss 510 heads and 490 tails. The results of the hypothesis test are reported to the right. Use this output to answer the following questions:
What type of statistical test has been performed?
What was the expected count for heads?
Show how df was calculated.
State the Null and Alternate hypothesis for the hypothesis test reported.
Interpret the hypothesis test and draw a conclusion in context.

H0: The population probability of tossing a head or tail is .5. HA: The population probability of tossing a head or tail  is not equal to .5. 
The results of the hypothesis test were not statistically significant as the p-value was greater than the significance level of 0.05. The assumption that the coin was fair held. 

Question 28

A chi-square test of association because the investigators are interesting in the association between two categorical variables. 
H0: There is no association between area of residence and type of mobile phone. HA: There is an association between area of residence and type of mobile phone.
The results of the hypothesis test was statistically significant as the p-value was less than the significance level of 0.05. There was a statistically significant association between area of residence and type of mobile phone.
The data suggest that rural residents are far more likely to own cell phones than smartphones, while suburban and urban residents are just as likely to own either.

The slope was statistically significant, p < .001. There was a statistically significant linear relationship between a mother’s and child’s height. 
While statistically significant, mothers’ height only explained 4% of the variability in their children’s’ height.
