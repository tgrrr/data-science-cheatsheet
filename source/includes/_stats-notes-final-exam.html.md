# STATS NOTES FINAL EXAM

# Module 4

Which should I report?

## Binomial-distribution:
- = bi = only 2 options.
- applied to discreet only



Either they survive, or they die.

Defined by the number of trials
The probability of success.

## Conditional Probability


Calculate the mean
see if value is far from mean
Far from mean, less likely it will happen

P (B | A) = PA upside down U B

## Poisson distribution
lambda x t = per day


- refers to discreet random variables
When we use it:
- Rate of occurence per unit of time or distance
  - concentrate on time
  (eg deaths on the road per year)
  (number of passengers arriving on Xmas day in )
- Not use it if it's less than something

Only 1 param:
- Rate of occurance
- something about lambda
- What is the probab
Lambda * t is 10* 7 = 70

Have to multiply lambda

- Not expected to know formula

## Normal distribution
- Bell shaped
- centre is always mean
- is symmetric
- Tail is almost touching X

Regardless of p or d

1. X ~ N (mu, sigma squared)



99.7% of value fall between mu +- 3 sigma
95% of value fall bewee     mu +- 2 sigma
68% of value                mu +- 1 sigma

- We don't care if we have equals sign or not
- It's about area under your curve

If given mu and sigma, we can calculate X When something is given to you TODO:



# Module 5

For any

Population with mean


Not talking about distribution of population

Population with mean sigma variance sigma squaredu










# Central limit theorum


If sample size large
and some other stuff
If sample is drawn from normal po

Then



Define Xbar
mean is

variance is sigma^2 / n





# 6.


If Xbar is = point definition of


If asked for error

error is sigma / square root of n



P^ hat



# Confidence level

Significance level alpha

TODO copy formula here

This is when we might use T

If use T, we replace sigma with S


Every time I change the formula
My confidence interval keeps changing


If I increase size of sample
sigma divided by square root of n
Confidence interval shrinks

mean becomes closer to actual mu
becomes more accurate

If I increase the level of my confidence

If I want a higher level of confidence
then alpha is 1%.

Then

# Confidence interval for proportion

When sample size large, always normal distribution so use z



# 7. Hypothesis testing

H0
If testing mean or proportion value
always have equal sign to value
Eg. mean is equal to 100

Write H0 and H1

Write whether test is significance/or not
It's significant if we reject H0
Test is not significant when
at level alpha = 5%

If alpha is given to you, we have to use alpha.
If not, we can always assume alpha is 5%

! We reject if P value is less than alpha
If value of mu under H

We reject H0 if 100 falls in Confidence something is

Rejection region (not examinable)


Didn't examine this
Type I errors - sample is wrong, and
Type II errors


TODO: add pregnant and boy who cried wolf here

2 sample test

1. Assumption 1: 2 populations are independent
2. both populations are normal
3. Samples taken for two populations

We ahve to assume sigma^2 = sigma^2 of population

We use Levene test


If p value is less than alpha

or 95%


We're testing the difference between mu1 and mu2
m1 - m2

This is where we're looking for if the value of something falls around zero
(one is plus, the other is negative)




# Paired Data
-


# Module 8


Goodness of time

categorical variables

H0 P black = 20 p blue = 30% P yellow = 50%

Ha the above is not what is given under h0

Use chi squared test

df (degrees of freedom)

Called goodness of fit


# Test of association

More than one categorical variable
- Want to know if there is relationship
- or relationship between levels

Expected value

Expected value = n(
  
  

  )
  
  
  Then degrees of freedom
  
  
  Then we get something about goodness of fit
  
  
# mod 9. Regression equation

y = alpha (intercept) + B(slope)X

Testing if there's a significant relationship between Y and X

H0: there is no significant relation
HA: there is a signifcant relationship


Something about looking for P value
Look for positive or negative sign
