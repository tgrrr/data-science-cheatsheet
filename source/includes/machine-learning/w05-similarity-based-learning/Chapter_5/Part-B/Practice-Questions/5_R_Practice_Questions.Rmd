# Dataset Description

Using mlr [@mlr], the objective is to predict phishing websites from the [PhishingWebsites](https://www.openml.org/d/4534s) dataset provided by @hud19220. It is accessible at https://www.openml.org/d/4534. It has:

* Target feature: `Result`. Note that the data dictionary does not tell which value represents a phishing website. We can assume `Result = -1` as a legitimate website where `Result = -1` means phishing.
* 30 descriptive nominal features. For more details, see the website.

# Questions

1. Read the data set and convert the descritpive features to nominal if necessary.
2. Configure a classification task using `mlr`.
3. Configure at least three classification learners including `randomForest`, `rpart`, and `kknn` with `predict.type = 'response'`.
4. Train the models.
5. Prune the `rpart` learner if necessary
6. Fine-tune hyperparameter of the pruned `rpart` model.
7. Fine-tune hyperparameter of other learners
8. Benchmark the tuned models. Which model performs the best by `mmce`?

# Challenging questions

1. Try a classification learner using `mlr` with `predict.type = 'prob'`, Note that hyperparameter fine-tuning process will be different.
2. Ensemble the tuned models with `mlr`. Hint: `makeStackedLearner()`
3. Does the ensembled model improve the `mmce` of the best tuned model?
