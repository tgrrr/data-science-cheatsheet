Course Project
The idea with the course project is to apply what you have learned in class, and more importantly, to have fun!
This project entails applying machine learning techniques on a problem of your own choosing. The project shall be submitted in two phases.

Programming Language for the Project
The project must be done in either

Python with the results reported in Jupyter notebook, or,
R with the results reported in R markdown.
No other programming languages will be accepted for the course project.
You are free to use either language in either phase. That is, if you like, you can do first phase in R and second phase in Python, or vice versa. Regardless of what language you use, each phase report must be submitted as a single PDF file. This is a strict requirement. If you insist on submitting multiple PDF files, only the first one shall be marked.

 

Important Compliance Policy: You may not submit any previous work from RMIT or any other place for this project, even if they were done by yourself. RMIT policy is that a particular work can be submitted only once for credit.

 

 The first phase includes the following two tasks:

(1) Detailed descriptive statistical analysis of the data (charts, graphs, interactions, etc) as appropriate.

(2) Data preprocessing (dealing with missing values, outliers, data transformation, data aggregation, etc.) as appropriate.

The second phase shall include applications of machine learning techniques as appropriate.

 

Important notes about the project:
The project needs to be on a supervised machine learning problem as we will not cover unsupervised methods in this class. Both classification (categorical response) and regression (numerical response) problems are accepted.
 This is a loosely defined project to give you the maximum level of flexibility. In particular, you will need to choose a project topic yourself.
Even though there are no hard restrictions on the project topic, the topic you choose must apparently be appropriate for a major machine learning course project at a postgraduate level. For instance, Iris or Titanic datasets are not allowed. In addition, you may not use the same datasets in the sample projects.
In general, time series data will not be appropriate for your course project. That is, if your data has a strong time dimension that you cannot ignore, you must find another topic.
Data preprocessing is more than just filling in missing values or removing outliers. I suggest you have a look at the sample project phase 1 report for some examples. You should also take a look at Chapter 3 in the textbook that talks about data preprocessing.
If your dataset is completely preprocessed, that's OK, but in this case we will expect that you spend some more effort on the descriptive statistics/ initial data analysis tasks.
In Phase 2, you must try least three different ML algorithms on your problem and you must present performance comparisons to indicate which method seems to work best. If you like, you may also use algorithms not covered in class (deep learning, etc).
Sum of the text portions of your reports (that is, materials other than your computer code and their outputs such as tables, graphs, etc.), must be between 3 to 10 pages for each phase. Together with your computer code and their outputs (tables, graphs, etc.), your reports must be between 10 to 30 pages for each phase.
 

Please follow the instructions below for both Phase 1 and Phase 2:
The project reports must be a single PDF file compiled from R markdown or Python jupyter notebook. 
The reports should contain a Table of Contents on the first page, though this is not a strict requirement.
Submissions are to be made via Canvas by the due date and time.
You are to work alone or in groups of at most two members (this is a strict requirement: no more than two members).
Group work is strongly recommended as expectations shall be the same for solo and team work. In case of a team, both members shall receive the same grade.
Please avoid unnecessary content in your reports. For instance, you will definitely lose points for pages and pages of meaningless computer output or any other content that serves no purpose other than increasing your page count.
Kaggle competitions are accepted as a project provided that the work you submit belongs entirely to you.
You will lose points for any instructions that you fail to follow.
Please see Course Policies for late report submission penalties.

 

Group Submission Instructions:
If you are working in a group, the report must contain the names and student ID's of both group members at the top of the first page.
You must make only one submission per group. The group member making the submission will get the Canvas feedback. The other member will just see their group's mark. For this reason, the group member receiving the feedback is required to inform the other group member of this feedback.
If you would like to change your group membership between project phases, you must inform course coordinator of this change.
 

Project Phase 1:
Weight: 10%
Feedback mode: 
Feedback will be provided using Canvas. 

Learning Objectives Assessed:
This assessment task supports CLOs 1, 2, 3 & 4
Rubric:
Your Phase I report must include the following (20 points total):

(3 points) Appropriateness, the source, and a clear description of the dataset under consideration. In particular, the project topic you choose must be appropriate for a major machine learning course project. You also need to cite your data source properly and you need to clearly identify your dependent variable.
(3 points) Appropriateness and a clear statement of your goals and objectives for learning from this particular data. 
(5 points) Data preprocessing as appropriate. The preprocessing steps need to be justified and each step needs to be clearly articulated.
(5 points) Charts, graphs, numerical summaries, etc. as appropriate. Your analyses should be tied to your goals and objectives rather than being just random. Specifically, you need to present a good real-world understanding of the dataset you are working on.  
(4 points) Overall quality of your project report: clarity, conciseness, coherence, and, general good writing practices.
Project Phase 2:
Weight: 15%
Feedback mode: 
Feedback will be provided using Canvas. 

Learning Objectives Assessed:
This assessment task supports CLOs 1, 2, 3 & 4
Rubric:
Your Phase II report must include the following (30 points total):

(4 points) A detailed complete overview of your methodology
(10 points) Details of the algorithmsâ€™ fine-tuning process and detailed performance analysis of each algorithm
(4 points) Performance comparison of the algorithms as appropriate (cross-validation, AUC, etc.)
(4 points) A critique of your approach: underlying assumptions, its limitations, its strengths and its weaknesses
(4 points) Summary and conclusions of your entire project
(4 points) Overall quality of your project report: clarity, conciseness, coherence, and, general good writing practices.

Disclaimer: These sample reports are provided to give you a rough idea on what you could possibly do for your project. You should not assume that these sample reports fully address all the requirements as outlined in the Course Project module. You must read all the instructions therein and follow them closely in order not to lose any points.
