# Conceptual Questions


1. Besides `NA`, list 3 other possible values to represent missing values in a given data set.
2. Give an example where missing values contain information.
3. Would scaling the continuous features change the correlation matrix? The scaling of a variable $x$ is defined as:

$$x \longrightarrow \frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}$$

4. Give an example where two variables are non-linearly correlated but have a zero correlation.

# Computational Questions

1. Pre-process and explore [Adult Census Income Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/) by @ron.
2. Replicate Table 3.3(b) - Data Quality Report [@kelleher, p. 59] for Categorical Features.
