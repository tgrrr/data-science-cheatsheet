```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = NA)
```

# Pre-requisites

Ensure you have installed the packages below

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(rpart)
library(mlr)
library(rpart.plot)
```

# Sonar Data

This was the data set used by @gorman1988analysis in their study to classify sonar signals. The data set is available at [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)). The alternative is to scrap this data from the `mlbench` package [@mlbench]:

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data(Sonar)
```

The dataset contains:

* One target feature which is `Class`. `Class` has two labels: `M` and `R`. `M` represents the sonar signals off a **metal** cyclinder at various angles. `R` represents the sonar signals off a **rock** cyclinder under the similar conditions.
* 60 descriptive features. Each feature is a pattern recorded from the signals in the range of 0 to 1. The features are named as `V01`, `V02`, ... and `V60`. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.


# Questions

Build a decision-tree model to classify the sonar signal from the Sonar data with `mlr` [@mlr].

1. Create a classification task
2. Configuring a `rpart` (decision-tree) learner with `predict.type = "prob"`
3. Training the learner
4. \color{blue}(Optional) \color{black} Visualise the trained decision-tree model
5. Making prediction
6. Performance evaluation with the mean misclassification error (mmce) rate
7. \color{blue}(Optional) \color{black} Determine the optimal threshold
8. Train the model by 2-fold Cross Validation resampling
9. Train the model by 3-fold Cross Validation resampling. Does one more fold improve the model accuracy?
